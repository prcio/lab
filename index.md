# 👋 Hey, I'm Dennis.
I'm an **Electrical Engineering & Physics student** exploring **computational modeling, embedded systems, and software development**. I enjoy **solving complex problems** and **building things that work in the real world.**

> "Good engineering is about understanding the limits and making them work for you."  

### 🚀 What I Work On
- **Physics Simulations & Computational Modeling**  
  (numerical methods, rocket trajectory sims, PDEs)  
- **Embedded Systems & Hardware**  
  (microcontrollers, PCB design, low-level programming)  
- **Software & Automation**  
  (Python, C++, firmware, system architecture)  

### 🛠 Current Projects
- 🛰 **Rocket Trajectory Simulation** (numerical integration & atmospheric modeling)  
- 🔬 **Custom Embedded Data Logger** (ARM-based microcontroller firmware)  
- ⚡ **Electrical System Optimization for Robotics**  

### 🎯 Interests  
Computational physics, control systems, aerospace engineering, embedded software, and designing things that push boundaries.
