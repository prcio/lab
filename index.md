### What I Work On
- **Physics Simulations & Computational Modeling**  
  (numerical methods, rocket trajectory sims, PDEs)  
- **Embedded Systems & Hardware**  
  (microcontrollers, PCB design, low-level programming)  
- **Software & Automation**  
  (Python, C++, firmware, system architecture)  

###  Current Projects
-  **Rocket Trajectory Simulation** (numerical integration & atmospheric modeling)  
-  **Custom Embedded Data Logger** (ARM-based microcontroller firmware)  
-  **Electrical System Optimization for Robotics**  

### Interests  
Computational physics, control systems, aerospace engineering, embedded software, and designing things that push boundaries.
